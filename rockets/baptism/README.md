# Baptism

Baptism is the first rocket I have ever designed. It's basically the simplest rocket you can possibly make. As this is my first foray into the rocketry space, I think the name is fitting.

There are no fancy electronics on this rocket. I've just shared the [design files](CAD_files/) and the [report](baptism.ork).

Once I've built and flown this think I'll add images/videos and a build guide to this folder.

## Objectives
As my first rocket, the objectives are very simple: just fly!
- Build a rocket that flies straight
- Successfully deploy parachute and recover rocket
- Nothing explodes and no one gets hurt

Should be easy enough right?

## Questions
- Can a fully 3D printed rocket fly?
- What kind of apogee can I get from A-C class motors?
- How impactful is fin shape really?
