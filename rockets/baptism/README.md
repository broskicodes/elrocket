# Baptism

Baptism is the first rocket I have ever designed. It's basically the simplest rocket you can possibly make. As this is my first foray into the rocketry space, I think the name is fitting.

There are no fancy electronics on this rocket. I've just shared the [design files](CAD_files/) and the [OpenRocket](https://openrocket.info/) [report](baptism.ork).

Once I've built and flown this think I'll add images/videos and a build guide to this folder.
