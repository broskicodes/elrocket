# Rocket Projects

This folder lists all the rocketry projects I've worked on.

Each project lives in its own sub-folder and is named with the name of the rocket.

Sub folders contain all files relating to a particular project. This will include CAD files, OpenRocket models, PCB schematics and gerbers (if applicable), flight data (if applicable) and whatever else is relevant to the project.

I will try to also try to add in depth documentation for each project. Including goals and results, videos, assembly guides etc.

Enjoy.
