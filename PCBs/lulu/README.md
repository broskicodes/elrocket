# Lulu

Lulu is a flight computer. I am designing her to be simple and small. The primary goal of the computer is to record and log flight data from sensors for analysis and testing.

The [v0](v0/) design of Lulu is complete, but not going into production (click to find out [why](v0/README.md#limitations)). I will start work on v1 redesign soon.
