# Ion (Prev Lulu)

Ion is a flight computer. I am designing her to be simple and small. The primary goal of the computer is to record and log flight data from sensors for analysis and testing.

The [v0](v0/) design of Ion (Lulu) is complete, but not going into production (click to find out [why](v0/README.md#limitations)). 

The redesign is now finished. You can find out more [here](v1/).
