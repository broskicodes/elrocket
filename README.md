# Manifesto

I believe that anybody who wants to should be able to build rockets in their garage. 

I'm not talking about shitty cardboard rockets that you can buy on Amazon. I mean real intelligent rocket systems capable of actually getting to space (or at least high into the atmosphere).

The goal of this repository is to help make that possible. I want to build a community where people come to share their designs, get inspired and learn from each other.

I'm new to the rocketry scene, but I intend to learn quickly. I will try to document my entire journey right here. All of my designs, code and schematics will live here, open-source, for anybody to use or improve upon.

Enjoy.

## Repo Structure
All designs related to my rocket projects will live here. Everything from CAD files, to PCB designs to code for flight computers (once I get there).

The structure will likely evolve over time, but for now I'm thinking something like this:
- Root directory (You are here)
	- Rockets folder
		- A list of rocket projects I've worked on
		- Each entry will be a folder containing files for that particular project
	- Satellites folder
		- A intend to design and develop satellites at some point too

## Contribution
I am just one person, and I'd love for this to be a community effort.

If you'd like to share your designs here please reach out to me at [braeden@brhall.dev](mailto:braeden@brhall.dev) or just make a PR :)
