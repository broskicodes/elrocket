## Manifesto

I believe that anybody who wants to should be able to build rockets in their garage. 
I'm not talking about shitty cardboard rockets that you can buy on Amazon, I mean real intelligent rocket systems capable of actually getting to space (or at least high into the atmosphere).

The goal of this repository is to help make that possible. I want to build a community where people come to share their designs, get inspired and learn from each other.

I'm new to the rocketry scene, but I intend to learn quickly. I will try to document my entire journey right here. All of my designs, code and schematics will live here; open-source for anybody to use or improve upon.

Enjoy.
